## Pokedex Analysis README
In this project, I analyze game data from the popular video game series *Pokemon*. In the *Pokemon* games, the player travels across a fantastical world, capturing a menagerie of tameable monsters, training them, and dueling them against other monster trainers to become the world champion. Each monster, called a "Pokemon", has certain qualities, statistics, skills, combat moves, and a host of other data points that we can analyze. This project aims to determine which Pokemon is the strongest and which qualities suggest a strong Pokemon.

### Relevant Files
This project folder contains the following files:
- **pokedexAnalysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis. Relevant code, data visualizations, and conclusions are included in this file.
- **pokedex.db**: SQL database created in SQLite3. Consists of eight different tables connected in a relational schema, with Pokedex number as the primary key.
- **pokedexSchema.png**: Visual representation of table schema for "pokedex.db".
- **datasets**: Folder containing each dataset used in the creation of "pokedex.db". Original dataset was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon with the name "pokemon.csv", which is included in the folder for reference.
